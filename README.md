- create table
- domain types

- **Movie Examples** from `movie.sql`
  - WHERE clause: can use many different kinds of pattern matching:
    - attribute names of the relation(s) used in the FROM.
    - comparison operators: =, <>, <, >, <=, >=
    - apply arithmetic operations: rating*2
    - operations on strings (e.g., “||” for concatenation).
    - Lexicographic order on strings.
    - Pattern matching: s LIKE p
    - Special stuff for comparing dates and times.
  - Selection & projection
  - Joins
  - `DISTINCT`
  - Renaming attributes
- **New Students Example** from `students.sql`
  - String comparison
  - Ordering of tuples
  - Sorting

### 3. Set Operations

- union, intersect, except
- SQL exercises using sample files



#### More exercises

### 4. Nested Subqueries

- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `HAVING` can itself contain SQL query - but `WHERE` is most common
- **MovieStars Example**
- `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS` operations
- try oldest, youngest, etc calculations using nested subqueries first
- *skip division query*



#### Exercises

### 5. Aggregate Functions

- Avg, Min, Max, Sum, Count
- groupings of your own (**Student Example**)
- `HAVING`

	 SQL Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs	https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_outer_joins



### 5. Null Values

- SQL Lesson 8: A short note on NULLs	https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_nulls



### Challenge Problems!

Use `prof.sql` for these problems.

Consider the following collection of relation schemes:

```
professor(profname, deptname)
department(deptname, building)
committee(commname, profname)

```

1. Find all the professors who are in any one of the committees that professor Piper is in.


2. Find all the professors who are in at least all those committees that professor Piper is in.


3. Find all the professors who have not offices in any of  those buildings that Professor Piper has offices in.
